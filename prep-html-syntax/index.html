      Yoda</a> is a fictional character in the Star Wars universe, first appearing in the 1980 film The Empire Strikes
    Back. He is asmall, green humanoid alien who is powerful with the Force and is a leading member of the Jedi Order
    until its near annihilation. In The Empire Strikes Back, Yoda was voiced and puppeteered by Frank Oz, who reprised
    the role in Return of the Jedi, the prequel trilogy, and the sequel trilogy. Outside of the films, the character has
    been mainly voiced by Tom Kane, starting with the 2003 Clone Wars animated television series. Yoda is an iconic
    figure in popular culture due to his distinct pattern of speech and role as a wise mentor.
